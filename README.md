# Walking RPG App

A location-based RPG mobile app that generates random creature encounters as you walk, making your daily walks more engaging and entertaining.

## Concept

Similar to Pokémon GO, this app:
- Tracks your location and distance traveled using GPS
- Generates random creature encounters based on distance traveled
- Provides RPG-style combat and interaction mechanics
- Encourages physical activity through gamification

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Location Tracking Service** (`src/services/LocationService.js`)
   - Continuously tracks user's GPS position
   - Calculates distance traveled
   - Monitors movement speed

2. **Encounter System** (`src/services/EncounterService.js`)
   - Generates random encounters based on distance thresholds
   - Manages encounter probability and timing
   - Handles creature selection logic

3. **Data Models**
   - `Creature`: Defines creature types, stats, and properties
   - `Encounter`: Represents an active encounter with a creature
   - `Player`: Tracks player stats, level, inventory

4. **UI Components**
   - Map view showing current location
   - Encounter screen for creature interactions
   - Stats/profile screen
   - Main navigation
